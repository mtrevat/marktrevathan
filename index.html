        <h1>Mark Trevathan</h1>
        <h3>Software/Front-end Developer</h3>
        <p>My story is short. I have been many things, and many things have piqued my interest. The longest and most rewarding of these things has been music (drums, keyboard, guitar, etc.). The second has been machining aerospace components for the military and/or NASA.  But the newest, and most valuable of all has been my interest in developing beautiful, functional websites and web apps. My dedication to this hobby/career is unwaivering, and will continue to improve with each passing day. So look around! If you like what you see, and would like to do some business together: please send me a carrier pigeon. Or, you can view my contact page and use one of those methods. (please choose carrier pigeon)</p>
